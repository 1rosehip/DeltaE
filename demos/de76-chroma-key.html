<h1>Real-Time Chroma Key With Delta E 76</h1>

<p>
    The demo below uses <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/learn/#toc-delta-e-76">dE76</a> to incorporate a poor man's chroma key: replacing
    green pixels with any arbitrary user input (in this case, red&black pixel noise).
</p>

<p>
    Click play, and be amazed*!

    The video itself is OK Go's "WTF" - they are a fantastic band, and released
    the green screen footage here:

</p>

<h3>Interesting Problems</h3>

<p>
    At a broad level, the demo works by calculating the dE76 value for each pixel
    on the HTML5 video, and then decides if that pixel is green enough or not. If that
    sounds intensive, that's because it is. Let's look at the fun problems encountered.
</p>
<p>
    In a rush? <a href="#code">Jump to the annotated code</a> instead.
</p>

<h4>The Root Performance Issue</h4>
<p>
    The code for this demo runs on a single thread on your CPU. That sucks.
    That means we are greatly limited in the size of arrays and operations we can
    work with.
</p>
<p>
    Had we access to a GPU, or the diligence to implement web workers, we wouldn't
    be having this discussion. We lack both; let's get to business.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Canvas Size</h4>
<p>
    The most obvious (and easiest!) performance improvement is to modify the
    canvas dimensions. Had we increased the demo to twice the size, the operations
    required per second would increase by an order of magnitude.
</p>
    
<p>
    Even on desktop, that probably means you'll get jitter. This parlor trick
    won't scale.
</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Goodbye, Standards. Hello, Performance!</h4>
<p>
    What's the best way to get performance out of a database? Do you add some indexes?
    Spend an afternoon profiling?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nope.</strong> You <em>Denormalize it*</em>. To hell with technical debt, remove all your
    schema integrity and make a mess of things.
</p>
<p>
    <sup>*Please don't take this as an opportunity to be pedantic.</sup>
</p>
<p>
    The demo does not use the Delta E library. Instead, it uses a version of
    dE76 that is optimized for performance. 
</p>

{% highlight js %}
var pow = Math.pow;
window.dE76 = function(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
    return Math.sqrt(pow(d - a, 2) + pow(e - b, 2) + pow(f - c, 2))
};
{% endhighlight %}

<h5>Optimizations</h5>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Cut Cruft</strong>: The function above doesn't include the excess
        functions that the Delta-E library includes; it has a single purpose.
        There is also no object instantiation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Limit Object/Prototype Usage</strong>: The function uses more parameters
        in favor of passing in two color objects. The two color objects are easier
        to use and manage, but that comes at a performance hit: accessing properties
        in an object means you're accessing the prototype chain. This is a bigger
        performance hit than you might think.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Localize Object Properties</strong>: Similar to above, we
        assigned <em>pow</em> to <em>Math.pow</em>. Although the strategy is a 
        good practice for high performance
        situations, I will note I didn't see a performance difference here.
        That would suggest the JiT compiler is already optimizing for this.
    </li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h3>No Integrity: requestAnimationFrame</h3>
<p>
    The demo uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame" title="request animation frame">requestAnimationFrame</a>
    , in place of something such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout" title="set timeout">setTimeout</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can think of requestAnimationFrame as UDP, and setTimeout as TCP. With the former,
    we don't necessarily care that every calculation is done: we just want something
    fast. If the calculation function gets behind, requestAnimationFrame will simply
    request the most current frame instead of the next one in queue.
</p>
<p>
    Among other benefits, requestAnimationFrame also doesn't eat your CPU if you
    switch tabs.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Smaller Arrays With Uint32Array</h3>
<p>
    It's typical to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8ClampedArray" title="uint8clampedarray">UInt8ClampedArray</a> when working with Canvas.
    It's very easy to work with RGB values this way. Unfortunately, we are also
    working with a much larger array.
</p>
<p>
    With <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint32Array" title="uint32array">Uint32Array</a>
    we drastically reduce array access time by working with larger integers. Any time
    you can reduce your array size, you should - it's a huge performance bottleneck.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Okay, But Now Make it Scale</h2>

<p>
    Making this scale involves getting GPU access. Luckily, that's something we can
    do with WebGL. If you write a pixel shader to implement the same logic in the
    demo, you could even have real-time calculation of Delta E 00. (And that thing
    is a performance hog!)
</p>

<p>
    Shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/brianchirls/Seriously.js/">SeriouslyJS</a>, 
    which has created a pixel shader to do chroma key on the GPU.
</p>

<p>
    That's all I got. View the annotated source below for some more context plus
    a few extra notes. Enjoy!

 * switch tabs. More importantly, if it gets behind in processing, it'll simply
 * jump to the most current processing job instead of lagging behind like setInterval
 * would do. A poor choice if you require every frame to be processed, but
 * perfect for our use case.
 * 
 * 2. Uint32Array - an array that houses 32-bit integers. Array processing in frontend 
 * JavaScript is incredibly costly. We use this in favor of the typical clamped 
 * 8 bit array, which is much larger. Using Uint32Array also gives us the ability
 *  to make shifts in binary to get RGB values. Easy peasy.
 * 
 * 3. For testing the three green values, I wanted to exit as early as possible.
 * Here it was logical to find the most abundant type of green, so we can
 * exit early if we find it first. So in order: we checked for light, medium,
 * then dark greens. So while the three checks would ruin our operation normally,
 * all three aren't called in the majority of cases.
 * 
 * 4. Most importantly, the size of the canvas is at play here. More pixels,
 * Mo' problems, my gramma always said. You could increase the canvas by a factor
 * of even 20% and get noticeable jitter on desktop.
 * 
 * Extra fun tidbit: we could use even dE00 in real time if we had access
 * to the GPU. This business is running on your processor - and that sucks.
 * If this was ported to OpenGL shaders, it would run smooth as butter. Oh
 * well. We love you still, Canvas.

     * switch tabs. More importantly, if it gets behind in processing, it'll simply
     * jump to the most current processing job instead of lagging behind like setInterval
     * would do. A poor choice if you require every frame to be processed, but
     * perfect for our use case.
     * 
     * 2. Uint32Array - an array that houses 32-bit integers. Array processing in frontend 
     * JavaScript is incredibly costly. We use this in favor of the typical clamped 
     * 8 bit array, which is much larger. Using Uint32Array also gives us the ability
     *  to make shifts in binary to get RGB values. Easy peasy.
     * 
     * 3. For testing the three green values, I wanted to exit as early as possible.
     * Here it was logical to find the most abundant type of green, so we can
     * exit early if we find it first. So in order: we checked for light, medium,
     * then dark greens. So while the three checks would ruin our operation normally,
     * all three aren't called in the majority of cases.
     * 
     * 4. Most importantly, the size of the canvas is at play here. More pixels,
     * Mo' problems, my gramma always said. You could increase the canvas by a factor
     * of even 20% and get noticeable jitter on desktop.
     * 
     * Extra fun tidbit: we could use even dE00 in real time if we had access
     * to the GPU. This business is running on your processor - and that sucks.
     * If this was ported to OpenGL shaders, it would run smooth as butter. Oh
     * well. We love you still, Canvas.
