{"name":"Delta E","tagline":"CIE color difference formulas in JavaScript","body":"# DeltaE - Fun With Color Difference Formulas!\r\n\r\nThis repository will be updated with more information (and a demo!)\r\nonce a tutorial goes live on Smashing Magazine.\r\n\r\n## About Delta E\r\n\r\ntl;dr - an organization created a way to quantify difference in CIELAB color space. And now you too can quantify color... in JavaScript!\r\n\r\nMore: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\nInstall via npm\r\n\r\n    npm install --save delta-e\r\n    \r\n### Use It\r\nA quick and dirty guide to using each of the three formulas:\r\n\r\n    // Include library\r\n    var DeltaE = require('delta-e');\r\n    \r\n    // Let's create two test LAB color objects to compare!\r\n    var color1 = {L: 36, A: 60, B: 41};\r\n    var color2 = {L: 100, A: 40, B: 90};\r\n    \r\n    // 1976 formula\r\n    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE76(color1, color2));\r\n    \r\n    // 1994 formula\r\n    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE94(color1, color2));\r\n    \r\n    // 2000 formula\r\n    console.log(DeltaE.getDeltaE00(color1, color2));\r\n\r\n\r\n### ...
